Heat and Mass Transfer Data Book Locator:
This tool is a web-based application designed to help mechanical engineering students and professionals quickly locate specific concepts, formulas, tables, and figures within the "Heat and Mass Transfer Data Book (Eighth Edition)" by C.P. Kothandaraman and S. Subramanyan (New Age International Publishers).

Purpose:
Navigating a comprehensive data handbook can be time-consuming. This locator tool aims to streamline the process by providing an interactive interface to search and pinpoint relevant information, making study and design work more efficient.

Features:
Comprehensive Topic Listing: A categorized dropdown menu lists key concepts, chapters, and terms extracted directly from the handbook's table of contents and important sections.

Dynamic Search Bar: Filter the extensive list of topics instantly by typing keywords into the search bar. This allows for quick navigation to relevant entries.

Detailed Handbook References: For each selected topic, the tool provides:

The relevant chapter or main topic.

Specific table names and their corresponding page numbers.

Equation numbers and their page numbers (or "Formula/Correlation" for unnumbered formulas).

Figure/Chart names and their page numbers.

User-Friendly Interface: A clean and intuitive design ensures ease of use.

How to Use
Save the file: Copy the entire HTML code and save it as an .html file (e.g., Index.html).

Open in a web browser: Double-click the saved Index.html file or drag it into your web browser.

Search or Select:

Use the "Search Concepts" bar: Type any keyword related to the heat and mass transfer topic you're looking for (e.g., "boiling", "conduction", "viscosity", "fins"). The dropdown list will filter in real-time.

Browse the dropdown: Alternatively, expand the "Select a Concept, Chapter, or Term" dropdown and navigate through the organized categories (e.g., "PROPERTY VALUES", "CONDUCTION", "RADIATION").

Locate Information: Once you've found and selected your desired concept from the dropdown, click the "Locate Information in Handbook" button.

View Results: The "Output" section will display the relevant handbook references, including chapter/topic, specific tables, equations, and figures, along with their exact page numbers.

Data Source
The data, including chapter titles, table names, equation numbers, figure names, and their corresponding page numbers, has been meticulously extracted from the "Heat and Mass Transfer Data Book (Eighth Edition)" by C.P. Kothandaraman and S. Subramanyan, published by New Age International Publishers.
